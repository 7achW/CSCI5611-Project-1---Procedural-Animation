First project submission for CSCI 5611: Animation and Planning in Games by Zachary Wieczorek

Attempted (out of listed fields to receive points):
-Basic Flocking (50 pts)
-Simulation Context (10 pts)
-3D Scenes with Camera (10 pts)
-User Interation (10 pts)
-Additional Behaviors (10 pts)
-Performance Benchmarks (10 pts)
-Report and Video (10 pts)

The logic used for basic flocking behavior was largely informed by the given Boids2D flocking simulation. 
Code for camera functions was also provided.
